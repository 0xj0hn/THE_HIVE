#### The Hive is a place for keeping my hacking notes. its not a complete hacking guide or cheat sheet archive, some sections might have introductions for basic concepts but most of them are quick guides.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Some of these notes are taken from various cyber security courses, websites, blogs, news and cheat sheets available online so i do not own all of the material. also everything  that i put in here was tested in a lab environment or real world.**
{% endhint %}

#### The main topics include:

* **Network Pentesting**
* **Wireless Pentesting**
* **Defense Evasion**
* **Low-level System Programming**
* **OS Security Hardening**
* **Password/Hash Cracking**

#### This site is a work in progress and i will add, update and change the contents as i learn more.

#### This book was inspired by [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/) and other similar projects.

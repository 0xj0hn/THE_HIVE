Some of these notes are taken from various cyber security courses, websites, blogs, news and cheat sheets available online so **i do not own all of the material.** also everything  that i put in here was **tested in a lab environment or real world** even if its a complete clone of another resource so **everything said here will work in the right scenario.**

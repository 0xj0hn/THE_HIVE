## Notes

the hive is **a place where i share my notes and the stuff \( the honey \) i learn about hacking, security and coding.** this **book is a personal long-time project so i will add more stuff as i learn and gain new skills.** these contents are not always complete and i encourage anyone interested in cyber security to check multiple other sources for learning such as the ones that are mentioned in the resources section of each part of the book. **some of these notes are taken from various cyber security courses, websites, blogs, news and cheat sheets so i do not own all of the material.** this isn't a full guide on how to become a pentester or anything like that, its more of a quick go-to for the times when i forget the steps of some technique or miss   a possible attack vector in a pentest.

**for those who are curious about the logo and the name its from the famous Resident Evil game series :\)**

**This site is a work in progress and i will add, update and change the contents in my free time. I'm planning for this to be a long time project with well-sorted topics and structured approach for penetration testing, specially targeting operating systems and network infrastructure.**
{% endhint %}

**The Hive is a place for keeping useful hacking notes.** its **not a complete hacking guide,** some sections might have introductions and explanations with screenshots, but **most of them are quick guides** as i don't want to make it unnecessarily huge.

**Some of these notes are taken from various cyber security courses, websites, blogs, news and cheat sheets available online so i do not own all of the material**. also everything that i put in here **was tested in a lab environment or real world** even if its a complete clone of another resource so **everything said here will work in the right scenario.**

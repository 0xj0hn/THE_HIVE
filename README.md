# The Hive



![](.gitbook/assets/logo.png)

#### 

#### Hive is a hierarchy of my notes on what i learn about coding, hacking and other stuff. the main topics are network penetration testing, system-level programming, Linux stuff, exploit development and reverse engineering.

#### i am by no means an expert in any of these topics and the only reason i write this book is to help other rookies to have an idea of where to start and what to learn first in cyber security world and also i want to keep my go-to notes somewhere online. 

#### **for those who are curious about the logo and the name its from the famous Resident Evil game series :\)**

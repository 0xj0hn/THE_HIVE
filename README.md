#### **Hive is a long-term project with** the ultimate goal of creating a general methodology and manual for network and infrastructure penetration testing.&#x20;

The documents and techniques discussed here are taken from various sources such as blogs, cyber security courses, cheat sheets, books, CTF experience and personal researches. **the soul purpose of this "book" is to** **make network penetration testing easier, keeping my notes somewhere handy and hopefully, giving back to the community. **

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Hive was inspired by [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz) and many other similar projects.

#### Your contributions are highly appreciated, you can [submit pull requests to hive](https://github.com/7h3w4lk3r/THE\_HIVE) and support me with a :star: if you like.

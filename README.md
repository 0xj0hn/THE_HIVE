## The Hive

### Hive is a hierarchy of my notes on what i learn about coding, hacking and other stuff. the main topics are network penetration testing, system-level programming, linux stuff, exploit development and reverse engineering.  **are curious about**

### **Since this is a side project of mine and im busy with other stuff, it might take a while to upload all the topics that are ready right now.**

**for those who are curious about the logo and the name its from the famous ResidentEvil game series :\)**

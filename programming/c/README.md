# C

C might sound like a bit old when it comes to the new era of coding and software development specially when the social media and software companies are filled with web developers/designers, AI and ML folks and so-called data scientists. but when it comes to software security, reversing and exploit development, C is the first language to know because its the only low-level language with a high-level syntax and teachs you everything you need to know about how computers work and how you can manage and manipulate memory.

Here i try to make a simple and useful tutorial about C, for C++ i will only talk about the differences and OOP because C and C++ have the same concepts.

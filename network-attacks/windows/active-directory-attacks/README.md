# Active Directory Attacks

## Intro

Active Directory attacks is a huge topic. i certainly don't know every single possible attack vector and i am sure no one knows them all because a lot of the scenarios depend on the situation of attacker and network infrastructure. this section of the book is about the known active directory attacks and tips/tricks.

{% hint style="info" %}
Most of the attacks in this section \(in real world scenarios as well\) are based on the assumption that you already have a low-privilege access to a system inside the internal network or have physically attached your system and you are pass the firewall. normally, you wont see a domain controller out in the open or directly accessible from the internet, so most of the active directory attacks are part of an internal pentest or red team engagement.

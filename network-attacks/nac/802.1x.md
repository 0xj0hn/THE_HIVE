# 802.1X

a switch port is considered "closed" by the network until successful authentication completes. The client must use an 802.1X supplicant to authenticate to the network before the port becomes "open," granting access to the internal network.

When 802.1X is used for network authentication, three components are required: the supplicant or the client software, the Port Access Entity (PAE), which is the switch, and the authentication server, which is a backend RADIUS server. An EAP type is used to define how the authentication process should take place as well as the type of authentication used. In wired NAC environments using 802.1X on a switch, simple EAP methods are more common since it is not necessary to negotiate encryption keys or perform mutual authentication on the network. Weak, password-based authentication mechanisms such as EAP-MD5 may be used, although strong certificate-based authentication using EAP/TLS is becoming more popular.

To use NAC with 802.1X, all devices that are authenticating to the network must support the EAP method in use and have the necessary supplicant software. Devices that do not support 802.1X or do not support the EAP type in use are generally excluded from network policies (such as printers and other embedded devices), creating a bypass opportunity if an attacker can access the port.

#### Supplicant must be able to send EAP traffic to RADIUS for authentication. also switch is agnostic to EAP method, so it does not inspect packet content. so there is an opportunity to fuzz, exploit RADIUS backend before authentication
